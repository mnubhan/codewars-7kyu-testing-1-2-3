Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.
<br>
Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.
<br>
The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.
<br><br>
Examples: (Input --> Output)
<br>
[] --> []
<br>
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
